## [Unreleased]

## [0.11.0] - 2026-06-06

### Added
- **Mouse support**: Click to select tree rows, toggle expansion, scroll panes under the pointer, and dismiss overlays with backdrop click (ab-nzz6)
- **Overlay mouse activation**: Click status and priority options directly instead of using hotkeys
- **Mouse help section**: Help overlay (`?`) now documents supported mouse interactions
- **Pre-commit CI gate**: Local `make ci` target and tracked pre-commit hook run lint, tests, and build before each commit (ab-osz1)

### Changed
- **CI gates skip bead-only changes**: Commits that only touch `.beads/` files bypass CI checks for faster iteration
- **Dependencies**: `charmbracelet/x/ansi` 0.11.6→0.11.7, `modernc.org/sqlite` 1.48.2→1.49.1, `golang.org/x/term` 0.41.0→0.42.0

## [0.10.1] - 2026-04-16

### Added
- **Priority overlay**: Press `p` in the tree to open a priority picker; use `j`/`k` to navigate or `0`–`4` hotkeys to jump-select; Esc cancels; success and error toasts confirm the result

## [0.10.0] - 2026-04-15

### Added
- **Wide/Tall layout toggle**: Press `o` to switch the detail pane between side-by-side (Wide) and stacked below the tree (Tall); preference persists across sessions (ab-9kgu)
- **Assignee in tree view**: Tree rows now show the assignee; detail view also shows the `created_by` field

### Fixed
- **SQLite DSN path escaping**: Correctly escape SQLite DSN paths on Windows, fixing UNC path startup failures
- **Filtered expand/collapse state**: Collapse/expand state is now preserved per tree row in filtered (Active/Ready) views (ab-lv0y)
- **CHANGELOG duplicate headers**: Release script no longer inserts duplicate version headers

### Changed
- **Dependencies**: `charmbracelet/huh` 0.8.0→1.0.0, `charmbracelet/glamour` 0.10.0→1.0.0, `modernc.org/sqlite` 1.42.2→1.48.2, `golang.org/x/term` 0.31.0→0.41.0

## [0.9.0] - 2026-04-01

### Added
- **Close reason display**: Bead detail pane now shows why a bead was closed (ab-ekls)

### Changed
- **Closed items sorted newest-first**: Closed subtasks, blockers, and related items in the detail pane now appear in reverse chronological order
- **Removed `--db-path` flag and `BEADS_DB` environment variable**: Configuration simplified; use config file for database path

### Fixed
- **br comment parsing**: Normalized malformed comment rows from the br backend
- **Comments with no timestamp**: br comments with NULL `created_at` now load correctly; long comment text wraps properly
- **extractJSON robustness**: Parser now handles JSON strings containing brace characters without misidentifying boundaries

## [0.8.0] - 2026-01-21

### Added
- **beads_rust (br) backend support**: Abacus now supports both `bd` (Go) and `br` (Rust) beads backends with automatic detection and user selection prompt (ab-pccw)
- **Backend CLI flag**: Use `--backend bd` or `--backend br` to override detection without prompts
- **Backend indicator**: Status bar shows `[bd]` or `[br]` to indicate active backend
- **Backend selection prompt**: First-run prompts users to choose preferred backend when both are available, saved to config
- **Integration test separation**: Tests now use Go build tags to separate unit and integration tests (ab-64oh)
- **Conformance tests**: Verify bd/br output compatibility for consistent TUI behavior

### Changed
- **Client architecture**: Internal refactor splits Client interface into Reader + Writer for cleaner multi-backend support (ab-ynml, ab-nwke, ab-9srf)
- **bd backend frozen**: bd client frozen at v0.38.0 compatibility; br backend recommended for new features

### Fixed
